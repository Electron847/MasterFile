<h1>CSC 402/Data Structures I<br />Timing implementations of union/find</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Setting up</h2>
<p>
In the <code>src</code> directory in Eclipse, create a package called <code>timeuf</code>. Inside that package, create a class called <code>TimeUF</code>.  This creates a shell program with a mostly empty main method.  All of your code will go in the main method.
</p>
<p>
In the main method, declare a timer, which is a variable of type <code>Stopwatch</code>, and a count, which is a variable of type <code>int</code>.  Ther are for UF classes in the algs14 package:
<ul>
<li>QuickFindUF
<li>QuickUnionUF
<li>WeightedUF
<li>CompressionUF
</ul>
For each one, write a block of code that:
<ol>
<li>Directs <code>StdIn</code> to read from the file <code>"data/uf16k.txt"</code>
<li>Reads an integer from StdIn into the count
<li>Initializes the timer to a new Stopwatch object
<li>Declares and initalizes a new QuickUnionUF object, passing it the count as the size
<li>While StdIn is not empty (that is, while there is input to read):
<ul>
<li>Reads an integer from to StdIn into a variable p
<li>Reads an integer from to StdIn into a variable q
<li>Unions p and q using the union method of the QuickUnionUF object
</ul>
<li>Prints to StdOut how long this took by using the elapsedTimer method on the timer variable
</ol>
You will also have to download the data file <a href="uf16k.txt"><code>uf16k.txt</code></a> and drag it into the data directory in Eclipse.
</p>
<p>Use the sample program <a href="TimeLists.java"><code>TimeLists.java</code></a> for an example of how to do most of what is written above.  Its main method contains three blocks of code, each one timing a different list implementation from the classes defined in the algs13 package.  In Eclipse, create a package called <code>csc402</code> and drag <code>TimeLists.java</code> into it.  From there, you should be able to run it.  It uses a data file called <a href="32Kints.txt"><code>32KInts.txt</code></a> that you download and drag into the data directory.
</p>
<p>
To give you a more concrete idea of what I expect, here is the output from my solution.  Note that your times may differ.
<pre>
--- Times to execute various UF implementations from a file ---
Quick find took  6.748000 seconds.
Quick union took  0.048000 seconds.
Weighted UF took  0.062000 seconds.
Compression UF took  0.031000 seconds.
