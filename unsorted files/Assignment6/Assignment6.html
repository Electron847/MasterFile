<h1>Data Structures II<br />Assignment 6</h1>
<h2>Due Friday, November 9th</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Undirected graphs and breadth-first search</h2>
<p>
In this assignment, you are given three data files:
<ul>
<li><a href="a6cities.txt"><code>a6cities.txt</code></a>: List of midwestern cities
<li><a href="a6majorcities.txt"><code>a6majorcities.txt</code></a>: List of those cities that are major hubs
<li><a href="a6connections.txt"><code>a6connections.txt</code></a>: List of direct connections between those cities
</ul>
Download and place these files into the Eclipse data directory.
</p>
<p>
Write a program called <code>ShortestDistances</code> that:
<ol>
<li>Reads the list of cities into a string array using <code>StdIn.readAllStrings()</code> and then builds a symbol table where the key is the name of a city and the value is an integer from 0 to the number of cities minus one.  The first city gets 0, the second gets 1, and so forth.
<li>Reads the list of major cities into a string array using <code>StdIn.readAllStrings()</code>.
<li>Creates an empty undirected graph using the class <code>algs41.Graph</code>.  In this graph, each vertex represents a city.  As we discussed, the vertices of an undirected graph are labelled with non-negative integers.  When the vertices represent real world objects, this makes it difficult to connect a vertex's integer label with its real world label.  You will use the symbol table just constructed to make this connection.
<li>Reads in each connection from the connections data file, one line at a time, where each line contains the names of two cities.  As it reads in each line, it adds an edge to the graph.  To do this, it will have to translate from the cities given on each connection line to their corresponding vertex numbers.
<li>Prints a header line for the table to follow (see code below for printing this header).
<li>For each city:
<ul>
<li>Creates a <code>BreadthFirstPaths</code> object with that city as the starting vertex
<li>For each major city
<ul>
<li>Prints the shortest distance from the major city to the city in the outer loop
</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of the first few lines of expected output:
<pre>
                    Chicago     KansasCity  Milwaukee   Minneapolis SaintLouis
Alton                     5           3           6           9           1
Appleton                  3           8           2           2           9
Carbondale                5          10           6           9          11
Carlinville               4           4           5           8           2
</pre>
</p>
<p>
To print the header line, use code something like this:
<pre>
		StdOut.printf("%20s", "");
		for (String majorCity: majorCities) {
			StdOut.printf("%-12s", majorCity);
		}
		StdOut.println();
</pre>
Print each numeric entry in the table formatted using the format string <code>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%3d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</code>.  That's four spaces before the specifier and five after.
</p>
<h2>Grading rubric</h2>
<p>
The program is worth 20 points.  Code that doesn't compile or that compiles and then crashes will be given 0 points.  The 20 points will be allocated as follows:
<ul>
<li>Reading the data files into arrays properly (2 points);
<li>Building the symbol table correctly (3 points);
<li>Building the graph correctly (5 points);
<li>Having the correct logic in the outer loop (5 points);
<li>Having the correct logic in the inner loop (5 points).
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Submission instructions</h2>
<p>
Create a zip file called <code>ShortestDistances.zip</code> to contain only the Java file for the class.  Submit that zip file into the provided Submission folder on D2L.
